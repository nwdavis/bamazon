# Bamazon - Amazon-lite web app

This app allows users to place orders on existing inventory, and allows managers the ability to view existing/remaining inventory, view low stock, increase the stock of a given item, and add an entirely new item to the store.

To run the customer side, run node bamazonCustomer.js to make a purchase, and follow the prompts. To run the manager side, run node bamazonManager.js, and again, follow the prompts.
